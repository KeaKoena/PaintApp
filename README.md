# 🎨 PaintApp - Java Swing Paint Cost Calculator

**PaintApp** is a desktop application built with **Java Swing** that helps users calculate the total cost of paint required for a room based on its dimensions in meters. 
It provides an easy-to-use graphical interface for entering measurements and instantly displays the calculated wall area, number of paint tins needed, total cost including VAT, and change from payment.
